\title{Simulate locus tree within species tree and gene trees within locus tree}
\usage{
sim_locustree_genetree_msc(
  species_tree,
  gbr,
  gdr,
  lgtr,
  num_loci,
  num_sampled_individuals,
  theta,
  num_genes_per_locus
)
}
\arguments{
\item{species_tree}{input species tree of class "phylo"}

\item{gbr}{gene birth rate}

\item{gdr}{gene death rate}

\item{lgtr}{lateral gene transfer rate'}

\item{num_loci}{number of loci to simulate}

\item{num_sampled_individuals}{number of individuals sampled within each locus lineage}

\item{theta}{the population genetic parameter}

\item{num_genes_per_locus}{number of genes to simulate within each locus}
}
\value{
A list of lists of length 2. The first element of each list of length 2 is `locus.tree` the locus tree and the second element is a list of the gene trees simulated within that locus tree. All trees are of class "phylo".
}
\description{
First simulates a locus tree within the confines of the input species tree using a constant-rate birth-death process
based on values of `gbr`, `gdr` and `lgtr`. Then simulates gene trees within that locus tree using the multispecies coalescent process.
This is not sensible in most cases as there should be coalescent bounds at duplications and this function may be removed in the future

# first simulate a species tree
mu <- 0.5
lambda <- 1.0
nt <- 6
tr <- sim_sptree_bdp(sbr = lambda, sdr = mu, numbsim = 1, n_tips = nt)
# for a locus tree with 100 genes sampled per locus tree
loctr_gentr <- sim_locustree_genetree_msc(tr[[1]],
